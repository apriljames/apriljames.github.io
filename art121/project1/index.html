       <p>ART121 Culture Jam project</p>
       <p>This project was surprisingly easy and entertaining, as this was the first time I manipulated images with the intent of creating a product that not only looked natural and as if it were an actual advertisement, but also critique an aspect of society. After choosing my topic, it dawned on me that I have never been to Chick-Fil-A before, but they stand out so heavily in my mind because of their large, influential presence as a product of brilliant advertising. I love the way they present their company, brand, and themes through the creativity in their cow mascots and how they paint stylized, misspelled, snarky messages on large billboards. Their advertising methods are extremely effective in catching people’s eyes and causing them to retain the information. Because of this large presence, I wanted to select a event revolving around Chick-Fil-A that was rather controversial, and that resonated with my own beliefs. The controversy of Chick-Fil-A’s homophobic actions and expressions in 2012 came as a shock to many people, and I thought it would be a great opportunity to take this incident and work it into a snarky billboard message in their style.</p> 
       <p>This assignment focused on the exploration of Adobe Photoshop and its various basic features. Photoshop is a very expansive software with nearly unlimited potential in photo editing, design, and digital art. With this assignment in particular, I learned how to utilize multiple essential tools, such as crop, transform, color editing, and layering to create a mashup of multiple pop-culture images to convey a new meaning. I was able to focus on how to combine aspects of different pictures seamlessly and create my own unique image, which in turn gave me valuable skills, as it allowed me to explore Photoshop and get to know its important features that are useful for future job applications. I also had fun looking at different companies with big presences in modern, popular culture, and exploring ways to use Photoshop to analyze and critique aspects of their behaviors, actions, or philosophies that resonate with my own personal beliefs. </p> <!--  Add Text Here -->
